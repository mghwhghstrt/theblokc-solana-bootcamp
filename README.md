Rust code for deployed Solana program in '/programs/src/lib.rs'

Frontend code in '/app/src'

TO-DO:
- optimize code to minimize the transaction fees (dynamically allocate space for text_account data based on submitted text from frontend
- integrate other wallet sign-ins
- make the frontend more eye-friendly
- code to remove the prefix hex code that is added to the string saved to the blockchain
- add code to display Solana PubKey's other saved data that used the same Solana prgram
